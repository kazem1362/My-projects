            molly had been starting out of her window for about an hour now. On her disk, laying between the copies of <i> Nature</i>,<i> New Scientific</i>,
            and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>.
            It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spend it these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free

            She had spent the last ten years this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q> Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do
            </q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the 11ama  <abbr title="Doexyribonucleic acid"> DNA </abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement.
